## Dataset
Scikit-Learn Diabetes dataset

Objective: build a model that can best predict the risk of diabetes progression. This will be used as a screening tool to help physicians identify patients at risk. The models that we look into are:
1. Univariate polynomial regression models
2. Multivariate Polynomial models
3. Decision Trees
4. kNNs
In this lab, we will evaluate the models using R-squared, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. To do that, we will run a train-validation-test split.
Writing a good ML Report: Notice to follow a good notebook structure, and focus on readability and clarity of the code, insights, and conclusions.
